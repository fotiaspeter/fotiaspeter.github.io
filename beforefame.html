        <h1>Juice Wrld</h1>
        <p> Jarad was an outsider at school, he started sipping lean when he was 12/13 because he really liked futures songs someone who went to the same school claimed he was always spaced out and kinda strange. He knew he always wanted to make music hence didn’t go to college I think he was making music since 15, the reason he is one of the greatest freestylers of all time is because his mum wouldn’t let him listen to hip hop when he was young so he’d only hear parts of hip hop songs and fill them in himself with freestyles from a young age. </p>
